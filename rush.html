      <ul>
        <li><div class="question">What is "rush"?</div>
        Rush is a time for women who might be interested in joining a sorority to come out and meet the sisters of the sorority, with no obligation to join after the rush period ends.</li>

        <li><div class="question">What is a "bid"?</div>
        A bid is an invitation extended to someone to join a sorority.</li>

        <li><div class="question">What is "pledging"?</div>
        The pledge period is a time for women who have accepted bids to learn about the sorority values and traditions.</li>

        <li><div class="question">Why should I join a sorority?</div>
        Girls join for a variety of reasons: to have a support group, to help develop leadership skills for the future, to contribute to the community, to network for future job opportunities, and many other benefits. </li>

        <li><div class="question">How is aKDPhi different from an Asian Club?</div>
        The members of alpha Kappa Delta Phi are closer to one another, brought together by the bonds of sisterhood. Also, we are more spread out throughout the nation, with chapters in various other places. Lastly, alpha Kappa Delta Phi does not end after you graduate college.</li>

        <li><div class="question">How is aKDPhi different from a Panhellenic sorority?</div>
        Being an Asian-interest sorority gives the sisters a chance to learn about one anotherâ€™s culture and ethnicity. Also, our selectivity means our chapters are smaller in size so sisters have more of a chance to grow closer to each other.</li>

        <li><div class="question">How is aKDPhi different from other Asian-interest sororities?</div>
        alpha Kappa Delta Phi is the largest nationwide sorority, with 1000+ sisters all over the country. Thus, we provide extensive networking, traveling, and career opportunities.</li>

      <h3>Dear Parents,</h3>

The sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at Carnegie Mellon University would like to take the time to introduce you to our organization and assuage some of your worries and fears. First, a sorority is defined as a society or club of women or girls in college, with the respective members being identified as &quot;sisters&quot; of the sorority. The sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi (otherwise known as aKDPhi), specifically, are girls who have come together to pursue a shared goal and common interest. Originally established at the University of Berkeley in California in 1989, alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority, Inc. has become the largest, and one of the oldest Asian American Interest sororities with over 5,000 sisters and 43 chapters nationwide.<br><br>

Our chapter at CMU was established in 2003 by 14 collegiate women who hoped to forge a bond of sisterhood and keep in touch with their Asian American heritage, while participating in community service and achieving academic excellence. Since then, our chapter has continued to grow and form more meaningful friendships. We always treat each other with respect, loyalty, and trust, and collectively strive to become well educated, culturally diverse leaders and role models within our respective communities. As a well established organization, aKDPhi breeds girls of high caliber, integrity, and solid work ethic so that they will continue to succeed after graduation. <br><br>

We pride ourselves on having a thoroughly stringent academic program in place for all our sisters. There is a minimum GPA cut-off that is enforced; we also have an academic chair dedicated to overseeing and keeping track of all our sisters&#39; exams, projects, and grades. Our sorority provides academic help whenever needed as well as weekly study and tutoring sessions. In several cases, sisters&#39; grades have actually improved after joining aKDPhi, because part of our New Member Education process teaches time management and organizational skills. Carnegie Mellon University, in particular, is known for having had the highest overall GPA of all time &#45; 3.75.<br><br>

We sincerely hope that we have answered some of your questions satisfactorily. Feel free to browse our website and take a look at all of the FAQs for more information! If you still have any concerns or misgivings, do not hesitate to contact us! <br><br>

Signed,<br>
The Sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority, Inc.<br>
